No house without a mouse
Pride will have a fall
A bad workman quarrels with his tools
A bargain is a bargain
A barking dog never bites
A beacon does not shine on its base
A big fish in a little pond
A bad penny always turns up
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
A fool and his money are soon parted
A friend in need is a friend indeed
A man is known by the company he keeps
A man's home is his castle
A stitch in time saves nine
Actions speak louder than words
After a storm comes a calm
All good things must come to an end
It never rains, but it pours
Justice delayed is justice denied
Keep your mouth shut and your ears open
Laughter is the best medicine
Let sleeping dogs lie
Life is just a bowl of cherries
Lightning never strikes twice in the same place
Like father, like son
Love is blind
Love sees no faults
One father is more than a hundred schoolmasters
One good turn deserves another
One of these day is none of these days
Only the wearer knows where the shoe pinches
Opportunity seldom knocks twice
Poor men seek meat for their stomach, rich men stomach for their Meat
Practice makes perfect
Prevention is better than cure
Rats desert a sinking ship
The early bird catches the worm
The first step is the hardest
The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence
The last straw breaks the camel's back
The older the fiddler, the sweeter the tune
The pot calls the kettle black
There's a black sheep in every flock
There's no fool like an old fool
There's no place like home
Things are not always what they seem
A hero is a man who is afraid to run away
The first faults are theirs that commit them, the second theirs that permit them
As you make your bed, so you must lie in it
If you want a thing done, go. If not, send. The shortest answer is doing
A smooth sea never made a skillful mariner
A stumble may prevent a fall
Be not deceived with the first appearance of things, for show is not substance
Better a snotty child than his nose wiped off
Children suck the mother when they are young and the father when they are old
Use soft words and hard arguments
A poor beauty finds more lovers than husbands
A good beginning makes a good end
A blind man will not thank you for a looking-glass
An idle brain is the devil's workshop
Cheat me in the price, but not in the goods
While the doctors consult, the patient dies
'Tis money that begets money
Death always comes too early or too late
Death is a shadow that always follows the body
Speak not of my debts unless you mean to pay them
The difference is wide that sheets will not decide
He that seeks trouble never misses
Never step over one duty to perform another
A burnt child dreads the fire
A small family is soon provided for
Don't dig your grave with your knife and fork
Fools build houses, and wise men buy them
He is a fool that kisseth the maid when he may kiss the mistress
Friends are like fiddle strings, they must not be screwed too tight
You may poke a man's fire after you've known him for seven years
The best throw of the dice is to throw them away
Education begins a gentleman, conversation completes him
Take heed you do not find what you do not seek
Gray hairs are death's blossoms
If you want to be happy for a year, plant a garden; If you want to be happy for life, plant a tree
We are usually the best men when in the worst health
Hope for the best, but prepare for the worst
The calmest husbands make the stormiest wives
Many a true word is spoken in jest
Sometimes you must be cruel to be kind
A young man idle, an old man needy
Learning makes a man fit company for himself as well as for others
He that plants trees loves others besides himself
The mob has many heads but no brains
He that would the daughter win must with the mother first begin
Sticks and stones will break my bones, but names will never hurt me
Foul water will quench fire
Love your neighbor, yet pull not down your hedge
The ship that will not obey the helm will have to obey the rocks
Who is so deaf or so blind as he that willfully will neither hear nor
see?
Some men go through a forest and see no firewood
You must not expect old heads upon young shoulders
No barber shaves so close but another finds his work
Don't halt before you are lame
Poverty is not a shame, but the being ashamed of it is
Ask God for what man can give, and you may get it
A full cup must be carried steadily
A proverb is the child of experience
When the sword of rebellion is drawn, the sheath should be thrown away
Still waters run deep
Six hours for a man, seven for a woman, and eight for a fool
To talk without thinking is to shoot without aiming
There is but an hour a day between a good housewife and a bad one
Time is the soul of business
It is an equal failing to trust everybody, and to trust nobody
It takes all sorts to make a world
Sell not virtue to purchase wealth
Sorrow for a husband is like a pain in the elbow, sharp and short
Where there's a will, there's a way
Two wrongs do not make a right
A proverb is the child of experience
A hero is a man who is afraid to run away
The first faults are theirs that commit them, the second theirs that permit them
As you make your bed, so you must lie in it
If you want a thing done, go. If not, send. The shortest answer is doing
